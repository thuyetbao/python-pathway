# **Visualization Concepts**

# **Description**


# **Chart Element**

## Know your annotation chart elements

[Diagram]

## Process to make Chart

a) Define Story, Concepts, Data, Visualization

b) Predefine Datasets and multiples attributes related

c) Organization Templates

## Plot Selection


## Story Telling Point


# **Common Tools**

### mathplotlib


### seaborn


## Themes Design



## Save Chart

How to save chart output?

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```

## Command Line Snapshot to output


## Common chart


## Snipset

In real-world, there are a little bit time to get the insights and visualization tasks is just a small components of it and
there are not a lot of time can spend to. So to make it easy for you to create multiple things, you should spend your time
to create a various set of componets and using it overtimes.

Using in [Visualization Snipsets](../topics/visualization/snipsets.py)

## Enhance with Class Chart

Class Method is one of the best way to enhance your chart in the concepts, both can using for R and Python.

```python
class OrangizationChart:
    def __init__(self):
        # Define Template
        pass
    
    def save_to(self, path, default_setting):
        pass
```


# **Advice**

1. Dont take so much time for visualization. Take your time to predefined set.
   
2. Clear target, dont make they think and focus on your insight/emphasize

3. Using multiple plot grid chart

4. Always giving more informations: like contexts of the charts, statistics number relevant

5. Sources and snapshot.
